# Vibe-Check UI Skill
**Instructions:**
1. **Visual Hierarchy:** Large, clear buttons. The "Action" button (e.g., "Convert," "Clean," "Fix") must be the most colorful thing on the page.
2. **Mobile-First Gestures:** Ensure all sliders and inputs are easy to tap with a thumb. 
3. **Empty States:** When no data is entered, show a beautiful, friendly illustration or a "Try an Example" button to reduce "blank page anxiety."
4. **Soft Aesthetics:** Use rounded corners (2xl), subtle shadows, and a "warm" dark mode (slate/zinc) rather than pure pitch black.
