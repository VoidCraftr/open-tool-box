# Aesthetic UI Engine
**Focus:** Typography, Motion, and Liquid Aesthetics.
**Instructions:**
1. **Liquid Glass UI:** Use `backdrop-blur` and semi-transparent backgrounds for cards. Implement "Progressive Blur" to focus the user's attention on the active input/output area.
2. **Fluid Typography & Scale:** Implement a fluid scale using `clamp()`. Typography should feel "breathable" with generous line heights and tracking.
3. **The "Alive" Result Factor:** When a tool processes data, use a "Liquid Transition" (e.g., a subtle pulse or a smooth expansion) to show the result. Never just "snap" the result into view.
4. **Adaptive Micro-Interactions:** Buttons should have "Physicality" (e.g., a slight scale down on click, a soft shadow elevation on hover).
5. **Thumb-First Navigation:** Ensure the most critical actions (e.g., "Clean," "Fix," "Convert") are large and easily accessible within the middle-bottom third of mobile devices.
