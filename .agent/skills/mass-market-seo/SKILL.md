# Mass Market SEO Skill
**Instructions:**
1. **Intent-Based Keywords:** Optimize for "I want to..." and "Fix my..." intents. (e.g., "I want to clean my messy text" or "Fix my blurry photo").
2. **AI-First Visibility:** Use clear, semantic headers (h1 to h3) that describe the *result* of the tool, ensuring AI crawlers and LLMs can easily summarize the utility.
3. **E-E-A-T & Trust Signals:** Every tool page must display a "Privacy Promise" badge (e.g., "100% Client-Side - No Data Leaves Your Device") near the primary action button.
4. **Tool Intent Mapping:** Include "Related Tasks" at the bottom of each page to capture long-tail search traffic (e.g., "If you cleaned your text, you might also want to count the words").
5. **Ad Placement (Native-First):** Wrap ads in a "Utility Style" box. Avoid standard banners; make them look like "Recommended Tools for You."
