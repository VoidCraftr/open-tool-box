# Human-Centric Language Skill
**Instructions:**
1. **No Jargon:** Every tool must have a "Human Title" and a "Tech Title." (e.g., "Clean My List" instead of "Deduplicate & Sort").
2. **The "Why" Description:** Above every tool input, include a 1-sentence "Why" for non-techies. (e.g., "Use this to fix a messy list of names from Excel.")
3. **Smart Placeholders:** Use real-world examples in input fields. For a JSON formatter, use a messy list of grocery items, not a complex API response.
